PERSONAL PROFILE
I'm a freelance web developer with several years of customer service background, with a handful of
coding projects within my current employment. I have always enjoyed helping my colleagues through
technology, and I have been inspired to dive deep into my love of tech and coding full-time. My soft
skills, especially communication from my current employment, have been tried, tested and improved
tenfold. From online courses, I have gained experience with Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Webpack
paired with my experience facilitating communication between stakeholders, programmers and
end-users I can have a clear overview of a project and what is needed to satisfy the balance of
requirements for all. Spurred on through the Odin project, I am energised to take my skills,
knowledge and eagerness to learn into this role.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack, JSON, Local Storage, hosted through Netlify
● Webpack, node(npm) to bundle assets.
● ES6 modules
● Commercial hosting and deployment through Netlify
● JSON and local storage integration
This project was my first time using JSON and local storage to help give consistency and data from
separate visits to help give a personal experience to all visitors, allowing people a functional to-do
list. I used DOM manipulation for the site creation and overlaying forms for input into the site.

discussion with owner ongoing for procurement)
● Webpack, node(npm) to bundle assets.
● ES6 modules
● Commercial hosting and deployment through Netlify
● Embed responsive google maps integration
This project introduced me to the powerful world of Webpack and how to clean and organise my
code through the separation of source and distribution files. How to use DOM manipulation to create
entire sites and learn core skills and principles for website creation.
Noughts & Crosses - https://isaacwild.github.io/noughtsAndCrosses/
April 22nd - May 9th
HTML, CSS, JavaScript - Simple game of Noughts and Crosses to cement my understanding of
fundamental programming and logic used for a game utilising clean web design.
● There are no items within the global scope to prevent console commands from changing the
game score.
● Introduction and use of IIFEs
● Introduction to the module pattern and factory functions.
With this project we had to ensure our global scope was clear and functions protected from players
trying to cheat the game, I focused on a pleasant and responsive design of the page for players with
visual feedback, returning to this project in the future I intend to implement an ‘Ai’ player for
single-player games and the greater use of objects to reduce code use especially in checking for a win
state in the game.
